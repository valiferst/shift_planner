SKEL: Skeleton Project

This project provides a starting point for development of projects during the
course "Software Architecture". It is a simple web application offering nearly 
no "real" functionality. Its main purpose is to help you getting started quickly 
by providing a suitable starting point.

It utilizes Spring Boot and is configured as a Maven web application project with:
 - all relevant Spring Framework features enabled
 - embedded Tomcat
 - embedded H2 in-memory database (including H2 console)
 - support for React
 - basic functionality for user management and Spring web security

This project works with Java 21.
Execute "mvn spring-boot:run" to start the skeleton project and install 
required js libraries.
Change .env.example to .env (can be found in src/main/frontend) and check 
that the URL is set to "localhost:8080" before starting the frontend.
Execute "npm start" in the folder src/main/frontend to start the frontend, 
which you can access at http://localhost:3000/ ([see also frontend README](./src/main/frontend/))
You can log in with:
- "admin" and "passwd"
- "user1" and "passwd"
- "user2" and "passwd"
- "elvis" and "passwd"

Feel free to use this skeleton project as you see fit - but keep in mind that
this project is primarily provided to be used for educational purposes. Don't
use it for production!
